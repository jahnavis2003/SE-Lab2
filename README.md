Hey! I'm Jahnavi,I am currently studying engineering and like to play video games.
I love hanging out with friends and talking to new people which clearly shows how extroverted I am.
Also, my favourite video game to play is Valorant and I am completely addicted to it.
I am somewhat a fitness freak , I go to the gym whwnever I can.
My all time favourite show is Game of thrones <3
